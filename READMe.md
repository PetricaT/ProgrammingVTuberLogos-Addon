# Programming VTuber Logos (addon edition)

Everything here shares the same principle as the main repo by [Aikoyori](https://github.com/Aikoyori), so don't use anything here comercially.

> [!NOTE]
> I usually browse Aikoyori's backlog and make ones he hasn't made already. If you'd like something made by me specifically, then put in a issue.
